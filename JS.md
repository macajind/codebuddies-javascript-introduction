# JavaScript

Interpreted dynamically typed multi-paradigmatic (Imperative, OOP, Functional) language
with prototype model and emphasis on asynchronous reactive programming (events)

## Basic Info

- ECMAScript standard
- Very dynamic adaptable and error tolerant
- Nothing to do with Java! ðŸ˜Š

## Brief History

- _1996_ - JavaScript origin
- _1999_ - First common standard
- _2008_ - First big update fixing some issues (Strict Mode)
- _2015_ - Another big update bringing countless innovations

## Usage

- Only natively globally supported programming language on web client side
  - Many other languages compile or transpile to it
- On server side via. **Node.js**
- Desktop applications combining browser JS and Node.js - **Electron**
- Mobile applications via. **React Native** and others

## "Problems"

_"Everyone knows a little, few knows a lot..."_

- Non-intuitive dynamic typing
- Prototype based object model (vs. class based model)
- Dynamic scope instead of lexical (behavior of `this`)
  - _Addressed in newer version of JS_ 
- Excessive error tolerance
  - "You can send anything anywhere, and it should deal with it without throwing unnecessary errors..."
  - Divide string with an object? No problem! ðŸ˜‚

Solution?

**If you know what exactly are you doing, there is no problem anymore!**

It's also convenient to use new features and syntax in the language. ðŸ˜‰
